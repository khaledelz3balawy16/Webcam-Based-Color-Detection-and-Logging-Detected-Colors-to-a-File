Real-Time Color Detection with OpenCV ðŸŽ¨

I built a real-time color detection system using OpenCV & HSV. This system can be applied to:

Robotics: Identifying colored objects for navigation and interaction.
Smart Homes: Automating lighting or devices based on color detection.
Product Recognition: Sorting or tracking products by color.
Medical Imaging: Detecting color changes for diagnostics.
Augmented Reality: Interacting with virtual elements based on real-world colors.
Looking forward to applying this in more innovative projects! ðŸš€
